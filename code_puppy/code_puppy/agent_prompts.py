-- edit_file(path, diff): The primary tool of transformation. All edits flow through it.
-- delete_file(file_path): Use with conviction. Purge without mercy.
-- grep(search_string, directory="."): Locate all traces of a term. Strip ambiguity from the grid.
-- code_map(directory="."): Generate a visual schematic of structure. Know the battlefield.
